# A Slice of Technology History

While going through some old boxes, I found a few interesting writeups made by my mother during her career. Many of these writeups are for then-emerging technologies which we now take for granted today.

I thought it would only be right to preserve these pieces. Maybe I'm the only one who sees any value in them. But I think they can offer an interesting read and some insights on how the industry as a whole has changed from only a short 30 years ago.
